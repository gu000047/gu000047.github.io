I was the second time to creat the portfolio by myself. actually, I think some a little bit chanllenge
by myself. this time I create the mockup which is relay on my composition and some work products.
I konw the basic create the webpage on the layout. I try to show the layout of the page with a more clean and tidy page visuals. this is the imprtant concept to design my mockup and create the best layout on webpage.
after I have a clean mockup , and I was very clearly mind on the layout. so it is easy to follow type code.
of courese, beacuase every time we have different design on our pages. so we need to think about it carefully
and detail inside before we type code. evertytime when I start to create page, firstly I srtarted my division
of my web layout. it's good habits to do it and I will appreciate on the preparation before this work.
let's talk about what difficulty during my work. firstly, i think this mockup is not conplex on my page.
due to I 'm current student and I have no enough composition or work to presentation on my space.so I 
think my web portiflio is also simple. Compare with grid and float, I would like to use flex. also wrap
is the key point that How does the content change its lines.because it is easy to complete something 
change you want. and I think it is very basic element to order layout changes.
In my page, I almost use margin, padding, flex, align-item and text align. In this case, I learn
the display block then set margin by auto, it will ceter the block elements horizontally. to be honestly,
the point of this I didn't catch it. so I understand and I can use this on it. it better and easy to 
place the block to the center. at the mean time, it really important to distinguish with element display:
inline-block and block. they have different property to presentation each style.so I touch in some new
element I have never use it before like line-height,transparent, cover,opacity, list-style,flex-flow.
this page almost focous on the layout in sapce of image. So this is a relatively difficult place,
 I need to use the flex and relative positioning and absolute to adjust the position of the block 
 elements, and the spacing between them, which can ensure that their position is neatly placed.
 Finally, the image and work products are created and designed by myself.
